Then, your seed phrase will be revealed!

## Backup Private Key

**Warning:** Exporting your private key could be risky as it displays your private key in clear text. 
{% endhint %}

Therefore, you should make sure no one else sees, or otherwise is able to capture a screenshot while you retrieve your private key, to avoid possible loss of your BNB/tokens.
