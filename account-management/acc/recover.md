# Import/Recover Wallet

When resetting your password for your Binance Extension wallet, you will need your 12 or 24 word seed phrase. If you do not already have your seed phrase saved someplace safe, please make sure to read [How to Reveal Your Seed Phrase](backup-wallet.md).

**Before trying these steps, confirm that you have your seed phrase with you as you will not be able to reset your password otherwise and will risk becoming locked out of your wallet.**

1. If your wallet is currently unlocked, please lock your wallet first.
2. Click "**Login via other methods**" &gt;&gt;  **Import seed phrase**
