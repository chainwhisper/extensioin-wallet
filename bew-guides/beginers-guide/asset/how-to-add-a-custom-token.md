# How to Add a Custom Token

Here's how you add a custom token.

* Open Extension wallet and click `Assets` to see the tokens in your wallet.
* Scroll down to the bottom and click “+”.
* Click “+” on the right corner 
* Paste the contract address. 

You can get contract address from this page:  [https://bscscan.com/tokens](https://bscscan.com/tokens).  For example, BEP20 USDT is \`[0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955](https://bscscan.com/token/0x55d398326f99059ff775485246999027b3197955)\`

For Ethereum network, you can get token contract address from [https://etherscan.io/](https://etherscan.io/).  For example, ERC20 USDT is \`[https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7)\`

* Click `Add Token` to confirm
* You're done. You'll now see it in your assets list so it's easier to track and use.
