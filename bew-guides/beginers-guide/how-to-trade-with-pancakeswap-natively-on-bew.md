**Note:**

* The default gas fee on BEW has been set for the **Fast** speed with the most reasonable speed.
* You can also adjust the gas fee and slippage by clicking the settings icon at the top right corner of the trading interface.
* Slippage is one of the reasons that lead to failed transactions. If your slippage is too high, your trade will not go through.

Once your trade is executed, you can find the asset added on your home screen and you can see this trade under **Activity**.
