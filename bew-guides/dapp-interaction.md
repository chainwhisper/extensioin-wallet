### Authorized sites management

{% hint style="info" %}
This feature is introduced in version 1.131.1.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
 Please pay attention to all the apps which have access to your account 
{% endhint %}

dApps need to ask permission to view users’ accounts. Users could see “Login” or “Connect” buttons on Binance Smart Chain dApps. These buttons will prompt a popup from Binance Extension wallet asking if the user wants to grant the site access to their public account information. For example:

[https://www.binance.org/en](https://www.binance.org/en) is the official website for Binance Smart Chain. This is a default and cannot be removed.

### Revoke Permission

Binance extension will remember which sites have been approved until the user wish to change their list. Once you wish to edit the connected sites list: You need to: 

1. Select the account you’d like to change
2. On the Account page, click on the menu \(three dots\) and lick “Manage Connected Sites”

## Override MetaMask Connection

If you wish to replace MetaMask with Binance Chain extension wallet when trading on dApps, just go to "Settings" &gt;&gt; "Conflicts". Then, enable the option of "Avoid conflict with MetaMask". In this way, BEW will pop up instead of MetaMask

##  Show contract function name in sign transaction popup

  
Instead of “Request" , the header is now the contract function name \(“get reward”, “withdraw” etc.\)
