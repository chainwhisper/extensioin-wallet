# Speed up your Transactions

When you notice that your transaction is pending for a long time, you can try to speed up your transaction by sending an identical transaction with a higher gas price.

Step 1: Click **Speed Up**

Step 2: Set a higher gas price. It's recommended to increase by 50%

Step 3: Click **Confirm** to broadcast this new transaction

Please wait for a while, if the speed-up transaction is embedded in a block soon, then the previous transaction will be invalid. But, there is no guarantee.
