# What you can do with BEW

### **Same address for two networks**

You can use Binance Extension wallet to control the same address on different blockchains, namely Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.

### Wallet Direct 

You can pair your Binance.com account with your Ethereum address now. Read [here](../beginers-guide/wallet-direct/introduction.md) for more details. 

### Binance Bridge

If you want to transfer ERC20 to its BEP20 equivalents, you can send them to Binance Bridge from the extension wallet directly. No need to interact with two different wallets.
