# ❓FAQ

### 1. Tokens not visible after withdrawing from Binance

Many users who interact with a centralized exchange like Binance eventually want to withdraw to a wallet that they fully control, like Binance Extension wallet or MetaMask. So once you've used their withdrawal form, what could be scarier than not seeing your tokens?

First, you'll need to use  Binance Chain Mainnet (BC) mainnet or Binance Smart Chain (BSC) mainnet

Once you've [added the asset ](beginers-guide/asset/)to your wallet, you will be able to select different networks to view the assets held by your selected account on that network.

### 2. How Much BNB You Need To Send Tokens on BSC

A standard Ether transfer TX will be 21000 gas & a gas price of 5 GWEI. With tokens, the amount of gas is typically gas, so the total TX fee increases to **0.0005 BNB** - **0.0006 BNB**.

if you try to send tokens without having any BNB in your account you will be told you have insufficient funds. This means you do not have enough BNB in your account to cover the cost of gas. Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) require gas and that gas is paid in BNB. You can think of this like a transaction fee.

You can remedy this by sending 0.001 BNB to that account in order to be able to make the transaction.
