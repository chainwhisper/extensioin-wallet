# FAQ

## When can I receive my staking rewards?

Since `validatorset` info is updated every day UTC 00:00, to make some room for the error handling, we distribute the fees of day N-1 in the next breathe block \(day N+1\). Thus, after you sent `delegate` transaction, you will receive your first staking rewards at the second UTC 00:00. Afterwards, you will receive your rewards everyday at UTC 00:00.



## When can I receive my unstaked BNB?

After you sent \`undelegate\` transaction, you have to wait 7 days. This period starts at UTC 00:00 next day
