# Connection Issue with Ledger

The latest Google Chrome release \([Chrome 91](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+log/90.0.4430.212..91.0.4472.77?pretty=fuller&n=10000)\)  causes U2F transport issues on third-party wallets like MetaMask for Mac and Linux users. Due to this issue, you might experience issues when trying to connect to BEW wallet. 

This issue also affects other Chromium browsers \(Brave, Microsoft Edge, etcâ€¦\) on the same version. 

Considering those changes significantly altering the user experience and the availability of WebUSB as the standard method for interacting with a USB device, we plan to sunset the U2F transport and migrate to WebUSB to natively communicate with Ledger devices. However, we will preserve old logic for Firefox. 

### Before you start

* Make sure you are using the latest version of BEW \(v2.4.0\).
